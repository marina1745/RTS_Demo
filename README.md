# RTS Demo

A small real-time strategy (RTS) prototype built in Unreal Engine to explore core gameplay systems and get hands-on practice with C++ and the Unreal workflow.

## 🧭 Overview

This project was created as an exercise to experiment with RTS mechanics and engine features in Unreal.  
The goal wasn’t to build a complete game, but to understand how different systems — such as selection, movement, combat, and UI — fit together in a top-down environment.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Landscape Sculpting** – Custom terrain created with Unreal’s landscape tools for testing unit navigation.  
- **Unit Creation** – Basic unit spawning system to generate player-controlled pawns.  
- **Selection & Commands** – Click-and-drag selection box, single/multi-unit selection, and movement commands via AI controllers.  
- **Movement & Pathfinding** – NavMesh-based navigation with controllable speed and smooth path updates.  
- **Combat System** – Simple attack logic to handle targeting and damage between units.  
- **Mini Map** – Displays unit positions and terrain layout for better spatial awareness.  
- **HUD & UI** – Custom heads-up display showing selection feedback and interaction states.
## 📁 Status

Not a finished game — purely an internal learning project to get familiar with Unreal’s architecture and gameplay framework.
